# stm32f411-adc
Single channel ADC conversion using software trigger tested on stm32f411ce. Individual registers are written to, not using the arduino library.

Added uf2 file for easy programming. Tinyuf2 for stm32f411ce "Blackpill" needs to be programmed as the bootloader in order to use the uf2 file.
